              <h6>What is Advanced Drupal?</h6>
              <p>Advanced Drupal is an accessible and user-friendly PHP-based web content management system (CMS). However, it is distributed under the GNU General Public License, which provides users with an open-source back-end framework for websites worldwide. </p>
              <h6>Prospects of Advanced Drupal</h6>
              <p>Advanced Drupal developers are already in high demand due to the changing working trends and increased competition. It ranks as the most popular Content Management System in the world. All because of its users and developers. Several businesses are moving forward to build their website with Drupal 9. Moreover, along with the basic features, the developers have transitioned to Drupal 9 and its various new features that will make their work stand out.

              <h6>Advantages Of Drupal 9</h6>
              <ol>
                <li><p><b>It's Quick</b> - With the most recent updates to third-party components, JavaScript frameworks can be directly integrated, which results in efficient computing power and faster response times for your site's end users. Drupal 9 also includes responsive images in the core, which improves performance as it uses the best-sized image for the device.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>User-Friendly </b> -  It becomes hectic to manage content and the platform itself. However, Drupal 9 includes numerous tools to assist content editors in focusing on content management rather than the platform. Its features, such as the visual layout builder, intuitive media handling, customizable content moderation workflows, and intuitive admin themes, make the work look systematic and eye catchy.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Pocket-friendly</b> -  Drupal 9 is its series ecosystem's first significant upgrade that will be entirely backward compatible. This means upgrading to the next major release (i.e., Drupal 10) will not necessitate a complete site rebuild.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Accessible</b> - Olivero, Drupal 9's new default theme, was designed with the WCAG AA accessibility standard in mind. Indeed, on Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) in 2022, the Drupal project pledged to make accessibility a core value and part of their coding standards. Thus, it gets even more accessible for users to deal with it.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Future proof</b> - Drupal 9 enables engineers to create a traditional web CMS or a "publish once and use anywhere" approach with a headless front end. This creates infinite new use cases for your content, such as emerging technologies like wearables and augmented reality.</p></li>
