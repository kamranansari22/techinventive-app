              <h6>What is Drupal?</h6>
              <p>Drupal, an open-source web content management system (CMS) written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License, provides users with an open-source back-end framework for websites worldwide.</p>
              <h6>Prospects of Drupal</h6>
              <p>In the current competitive scenario, Drupal developers are in high demand because of the popularity and ease of operation of the Drupal platform. You can find multiple businesses that use the Drupal platform for their websites. Furthermore, many businesses are still looking to build a website on the Drupal platform, so there is a lot of work available for Drupal developers. All you need to do is Buckle Up!</p>
              <h6>Advantages of Drupal</h6>
              <p>
                Drupal is consistently named among the best content management systems, or CMS, that can power your website. If you've never looked into Drupal before, you may not be familiar with its perks. You can create powerful websites and apps using Drupal, whether you're an individual, small business, agency, or enterprise. Let's explore why the many benefits of Drupal have resulted in a community that is both loyal and large.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><p><b>Open-source platform</b> - Drupal is an open-source platform, which means that it's free to download, use, and modify to a certain degree. Due to this, Drupal has fostered a community of over a million developers and users who can quickly respond to questions about installing, using, or customising Drupal. There are high chances that any queries will have already been answered on a discussion forum if they are common, and you can get your site working just how you want it. Drupal uses PHP libraries rather than proprietary code.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Flexible and Cost-effective</b> - Whether your website is a blog, eCommerce site, or something else, you can do it with Drupal because the CMS was designed to be an economical starting point that can be enhanced for your specific needs. Drupal's core modules will set you up with a tremendous foundational starting point, with more than 36,000 community-created modules you can leverage. Even highly-customized Drupal websites can offer cost savings in the long term for organizations over WordPress installations because of their flexibility and ability to scale.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Enterprise CMS</b> - Enterprises do not need to reinvent the wheel. With Drupal Enterprise CMS Platform Distribution, you can access the Drupal core, which you've come to rely on. International organisations these days especially find the country and domain configurators that come with Enterprise CMS. Enterprise CMS includes a theme along with SEO, integration, content moderation, teaser, workbench, paragraph, and multisite configurators.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Scalability and Security</b> - Drupal is not just a CMS but much more than that. With Drupal, you can share resources across several websites through its multisite function, which is ideal for organizations as well as Managed Service Providers or designers that maintain multiple resources for clients. Drupal's open-source nature and large community ensure that the code is examined from every angle. This highlights security vulnerabilities that can be hardened or closed in real time by Drupal's dedicated security team.</p></li>
